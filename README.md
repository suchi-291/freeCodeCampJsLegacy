# freeCodeCampJsLegacy
As a part of my 100 days of Code challenge, I'm embarking on this journey of learning Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures

I'm also adding a logs file, where I will blog about my progress so far on freecodecamp!

**Escape Sequences** 
\\n - newline
\\' - Single Quote
\\" - Double Quote
\\\ - Backslash
\\t - tab
\\r - Carriage return
\\b - Backspace
\\f - Formfeed

*I always confuse with the slash*

**Strings are immutable** - once a string is declared we can not reassign one of its characters using index, that is possible only for arrays.


**Function Scope** - *A function can have a local variable with the same name as a Global Variable, within the scope of that function, whenever the variable is called, the overwritten value is used, but coming out of the function, the variable will continue o have the global variable value it had unless and untill reassigned.*

When a function does not have a return statement, it processes the inner code but it gives the output "undefined"

**Queue** - 
A queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order.
New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.
new items will be added at the back, old items will be removed from the front, when new item is added, old one at the front will be removed 
*shift(), push()*

**someObject.hasOwnProperty(someProperty)**

**Record cllection problem was tough for me**
