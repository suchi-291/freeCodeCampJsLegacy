# freeCodeCampJsLegacy
As a part of my 100 days of Code challenge, I'm embarking on this journey of learning Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures

I'm also adding a logs file, where I will blog about my progress so far on freecodecamp!

**Escape Sequences** 
\\n - newline
\\' - Single Quote
\\" - Double Quote
\\\ - Backslash
\\t - tab
\\r - Carriage return
\\b - Backspace
\\f - Formfeed

*I always confuse with the slash*

**Strings are immutable** - once a string is declared we can not reassign one of its characters using index, that is possible only for arrays.


**Function Scope** - *A function can have a local variable with the same name as a Global Variable, within the scope of that function, whenever the variable is called, the overwritten value is used, but coming out of the function, the variable will continue o have the global variable value it had unless and untill reassigned.*

When a function does not havve a return statement, it processes the inner code but it gives the output "undefined"
